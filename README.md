# PrintOutput: Simple print statement executing on a string, solved by placing print 
statement in function

# LoadFile: Solved by opening a file, reading the lines of that file and identifying 
individual words using strip()

# UpdateString: Creates new string containing all characters up to the specified index,
then adds in the other string, then adds/concatenates the rest of the original string

# FindWordCount: Used count function to determine the amount of times the specified
string occurs in the list

# ScoreFinder: Uses len/range combo to iterate through list of names, determines
if there is the requested name in the list, and if so it goes to that same index
in the list of scores (to ensure the name matches the score), and prints out
the name and score. If player is not found in initial search, error message is 
printed

# Union: Concatenates two lists together using '+', and returns this version

# Intersection: Uses set function to find the intersection of the first list with the second,
and returns that list

# NotIn: Used conditionals and looping through list 1 and 2 to determine the elements that
are unique to each list. Prints out this new list.
